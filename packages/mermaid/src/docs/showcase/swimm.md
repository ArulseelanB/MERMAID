# Always up-to-date diagrams with Swimm

We're excited to showcase [Swimm.io](https://swimm.io)'s unique integration with Mermaid.

## What is Swimm?

Swimm is a knowledge management tool for code with several unique features. A main one is that we can keep internal documentation up to date as the code changes.
This integration lets you to keep your diagrams up to date as the code that it relates to changes. You can do this by "coupling" the elements in the diagram with your code. Swimm then checks for changes with each Pull Request and helps you make them in the diagram. See the animations below.

## Mermaid + Swimm = up to date Diagrams ðŸ¤¯

Swimm recently launched a new feature that integrates Mermaid diagrams into Swimm documents. You can now create and edit Mermaid diagrams straight from Swimmâ€™s editor:

The real value comes when creating diagrams with Swimmâ€™s [Smart Tokens](https://docs.swimm.io/Features/editor-commands#add-smart-tokens). Type a backtick (\`) within your diagram labels to code-couple constants or variables and you won't need to worry about the impact of refactoring on your documentation, as well as renaming those values referenced in your diagram. This means - diagrams that are up to date with your code ðŸ¤¯
