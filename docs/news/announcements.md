**Why It Matters for Mermaid Chart:**

- **Empowering Collaboration**: Our tools are designed to enable faster, more efficient team collaboration across any distance, leveraging the best of text, voice, and automation.
- **Opening New Doors**: Mermaid AI and our Visual Editor are breaking down barriers, making sophisticated diagramming accessible to everyone, not just software engineers.
- **Looking Forward**: We're not stopping here! Expect groundbreaking features like automated documentation tools, advanced AI diagramming, and high-security on-premise solutions.

**Why It Matters for Mermaid JS:**

- **Continued support from Mermaid Chart**: At Mermaid Chart, we value our still-growing Mermaid JS roots. As such, we have funneled back development and support to the project. Thanks to the successful seed round, we can continue to ramp up these efforts.

We are incredibly excited about the future and are grateful to the community, our team, and our investors for being part of this journey. Together, we're not just creating diagrams; we're designing the future of collaboration.
